A <b>REST server</b> that facilitates playing a number guessing game known as "Bulls and Cows". 
In each game, a 4-digit number is generated where every digit is different. 
For each round, the user guesses a number and is told the exact and partial digit matches.

An exact match occurs when the user guesses the correct digit in the correct position.
A partial match occurs when the user guesses the correct digit but in the wrong position.
Once the number is guessed (exact matches for all digits) the user wins the game.

<b>Technologies used</b>: Java, Spring Boot, JDBC Template, MySQL, JSON, Postman.
